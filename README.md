# Documentation and configuration files
a place where I am storing and sharing my documenation and configuration files from diffeerent systems I am using.

1. Monitoring folder:
  a. FluentD - contains my confugration file for FluentD that I configured to get logs from different systems. The main reason I am using it is to get Windows Event Logs out to    elastic search.
